# Bitwise Shift Operators

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given two positive integers  **a**  and  **b**, perform a  **right bitwise shift**  of a by b positions, followed by a  **left bitwise shift**  of a by b positions. Print both results separated by a space, followed by new line.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 5, b = 2
Output: 1 20
Explanation: 5 in binary is 101. Shifting right by 2 gives 001, which equals 1. Shifting left by 2 gives 10100, which equals 20. 
```

```
Input: a = 4, b = 1
Output: 2 8
Explanation: 4 in binary is 100. Shifting right by 1 gives 010, which equals 2. Shifting left by 1 gives 1000, which equals 8. 
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ a ≤ 100
1 ≤ b ≤ 10

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        // code here
        int c=a>>b;
        int d=a<<b;
        System.out.println(c+" "+d);
    }
}
```
